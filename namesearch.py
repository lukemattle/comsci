#A teacher uses a program that stores pupil names in an array. The array is indexed from 0, so the first element in the array is name[0].
#Occasionally the teacher needs to search for a name to find the studentâ€™s record number, which is index + 1. 
#Write a pseudocode algorithm that will search an array name containing max elements, 
#to find a name and output record number if it exists. If the name does not exist the user should be told the term was not found.  
#Use appropriate prompts for input and output in your solution.
